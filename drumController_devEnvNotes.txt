Running python scripts + pd: restart pd to avoid unpredictable / unstable response

To install working dev environment for drum controller project:

Install:

Python 2.6
add C:\Python26 to the Path environment variable (Control Panel->System->Advanced)

(location - Windows: C:\Python26\ / Ubuntu: usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/)

PySerial - the appropriate version

[apt-get install python-pyserial]

MIDI YOKE http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm (on Windows)

OR

install JACK on ubuntu https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToJACKConfiguration [apt-get install jack]
also install JACK Control - will allow you to use a GUI with Jack (installs under Sound/Audio) [apt-get install qjackctl]

---------------------------------

DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW; USING PYGAME INSTEAD

PortMidiZero http://pypi.python.org/pypi/portmidizero/0.1
Make sure portmidizero.dll is placed in the Windows/System32 dir
http://cratel.wichita.edu/cratel/cratel%20pyportmidi

TRY: recompile portmidi.dll on your laptop :) (or whatever box you're on)

---------------------------------

pyGame http://www3.telus.net/len_l/pygame/

ARG, NOT WORKING:
patch pypm.pyx - to fix "PortMidi: Bad Pointer" error - http://www.mail-archive.com/pygame-users@seul.org/msg14997.html

(thus, on Ubuntu, install https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pygame/1.9.1release-0ubuntu1 and then patch from http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/pygame.html - 1.9.1 patches
may need SDL as dependency - if so, sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian)
(on Windows - I think it will work to install latest binary from http://thorbrian.com/pygame/builds.php )

note: pygame has its own version of portmidi (and its own portmidi.dll)

[apt-get install python-pygame]


retrying 3/12 : install python2.6 on Windows, install latest pygame from http://thorbrian.com/pygame/builds.php, install pyserial, pygame on python2.6, test this
